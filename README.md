# About @abadyr:
**`Aspiring Developper`**

Aspiring FullStack Developper, currently learning C# & .NET through Visual Studio, as well as Database management.
I've played arround with the vanilla web languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

Once I'm confident I got the fundamentals down - the logic and fundational concepts of OOP languages -,  and I can code interesting (useful) applications without needing automatisation as a crutch...  
I expect I'll try some Python, and then Rust,  because I'm curious about these languages, and I'm courious how the 3 (with C#) compare against each other.
